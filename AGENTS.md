## Repo guidance
- Use `npm run lint` and targeted scripts after changes when feasible.
- Do not modify the production publish flow or Puppeteer PDF generation paths.
- Keep the LaTeX PDF Lab isolated to `/lab`, `/api/lab`, `/services/latex`, `/templates/latex`, `/fixtures/latex-lab`, and supporting library code.
